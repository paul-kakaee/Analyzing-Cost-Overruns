# Analyzing the Relationship Between Project Budget and Cost Overruns

## Objective
Explore how the initial budget of construction projects impacts the magnitude of cost overruns, providing insights for better budget management.

## Dataset
The dataset includes Project ID, Project Type, Initial Budget, Final Cost, and Cost Overrun.

## Analysis
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation and Regression Analysis
4. Reporting and Visualization

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the analysis scripts or open the Jupyter notebook for a step-by-step guide.

## Results
The analysis provides insights into how the initial budget influences cost overruns, with visualizations and statistical modeling offering practical recommendations for construction project management.
